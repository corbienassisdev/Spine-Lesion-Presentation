The website is accessible via [this link](https://corbienassisdev.github.io/Spine-Lesion-Presentation/index.html), hosted on github pages.
This is an academic project that I made during my enginering school, in partnership with students from the ergo-therapy school of Bordeaux.
It's basically a popularized presentation of spine lesions, from causes to consequences for the person involved and his family, including the 
medical follow-up.

# Technical points

* Based on a open source template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net)
* Hosted on [github pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages)

# Specific features

* Introductive video
* Horizontal scrolling

# Popularize the subject

To make our visitor captivated by the website, we tried some design or psychological tips :

* Keep the website simple
* Have a beautiful design
* Prefer images instead of long texts
* Create an "emotional anchor" by talking about car accidents in the first page
* Explain the spine lesion through a fictive character
